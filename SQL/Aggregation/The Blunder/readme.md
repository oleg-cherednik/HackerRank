# The Blunder
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the **EMPLOYEES** table, but did not realize her keyboard's 0 key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeroes removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.: *actual - miscalculated* average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.
### Input Format
The **EMPLOYEES** table is described as follows:

**Note:* *Salary* is measured in dollars per month and its value is < 10<sup>5</sup>.
